# EasyJob
I created this website with my team mates for our project in Usability and Software Ergonomics class. This website is called Easy Job which functions as a job vacancy portal. The users of this portal are divided into 2: job seekers, who can search and apply for their desired jobs, and employees, who can post their job vacancies.
